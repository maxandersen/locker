  longDescription: |
    The mvnpm locker Maven Plugin will create a version locker BOM for your org.mvnpm and org.webjars dependencies.
    It is essential as NPM dependencies are over using ranges. After the locking, the quantity of files to download is considerably reduced (good for CI and contributors).
